Passionate about designing impactful solutions that seamlessly integrate advanced technology in Generative and Agentic AI with practical applications, encompassing the entire development lifecycle.

Check out [My Portfolio](https://viswadarshan-024.github.io/portfolio/)

My work includes contributing to academic journals and advancing Tamil Language Processing using Generative AI. I focus on exploring and implementing advanced NLP techniques tailored to Indic Languages, in paraphrase detection and paraphrase generation. Improving state-of-the-art models to align with the nuances of Tamilâ€™s rich morphological structure and linguistic diversity.

I am dedicated to optimizing the NLP pipelineâ€”from preprocessing and feature engineering to solving classification and regression tasks. By leveraging the latest methodologies and integrating language-specific adjustments, I aim to create robust and efficient NLP solutions that enhance the understanding and processing of Indic text data.

I am an AI Researcher & Developer specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI with a strong focus on low-resource languages like Tamil. My work revolves around solving complex linguistic challenges, developing efficient AI models, and creating real-world AI applications that push the boundaries of language understanding.

## Development Expertise

I work at the intersection of research and engineering, ensuring that my models are not only theoretically sound but also production-ready. My technical expertise includes:

- **Model Training & Fine-Tuning**: Using Transformers, Hugging Face, and TensorFlow/PyTorch to fine-tune LLMs for specific NLP tasks.
- **LLM Engineering & Optimization**: Implementing RAG-based systems, model quantization, and efficient inference techniques for high-speed AI applications.
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Deploying optimized AI models using FastAPI, Triton Inference Server, and Streamlit for scalable real-time applications.


## Real-Time AI Projects

I believe in building AI solutions that have real-world impact. Some of my ongoing projects include:

- **An AI-powered Indic Chatbot**: A multilingual chatbot that supports text and speech input, integrating LLMs, ASR APIs, and real-time translation to provide seamless communication across Indian languages.
- **An AI-Driven Learning Platform**: An interactive Feynman Technique-based AI tutor, designed to improve learning through AI-driven questioning, explanation, and document-based topic extraction.
- **A Storytelling AI for Tamil & English**: A creative AI system that generates stories based on text, audio, and image inputs, making storytelling interactive and immersive.

## Research Focus

I am deeply passionate about advancing NLP for low-resource languages, ensuring that AI systems can understand, process, and generate text as effectively in Tamil as they do in high-resource languages like English. My research covers:

- **Tokenization Strategies**: Designing and training custom tokenizers (BPE, Unigram, WordPiece) specifically optimized for Tamil NLP tasks.
- **Paraphrase Identification**: Training BERT and other models on Tamil and English datasets for high-accuracy sentence similarity detection.
- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Developing entailment models with IndicBERT and XLM-RoBERTa for multilingual reasoning.
- **Efficient Model Training**: Applying hybrid tokenization and dataset-specific fine-tuning to improve model performance on downstream tasks.

## My Work Ethic & Passion

I thrive on solving real problems with AI. My approach is:

- **Fast Execution**: I work at an intense pace, quickly iterating and optimizing solutions.
- **Deep Research Mindset**: I go beyond surface-level solutions, ensuring that every model I build is backed by solid research.
- **Hands-On Development**: I donâ€™t just experiment with theoriesâ€”I write code, optimize models, and deploy real AI systems.
- **Impact-Driven**: Every project I work on is aimed at making AI more accessible, efficient, and powerful for real-world applications.

## My Vision

I am on a mission to bring cutting-edge NLP and AI research into real-world use cases, especially for low-resource languages. My goal is to become a leading AI expert in this field, contributing to research, open-source AI, and scalable AI solutions that can make a global impact.
