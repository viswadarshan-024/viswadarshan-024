<!--
Passionate about designing impactful solutions that seamlessly integrate advanced technology in Generative and Agentic AI with practical applications, encompassing the entire development lifecycle.

Check out [My Portfolio](https://viswadarshan-024.github.io/portfolio/)

My work includes contributing to academic journals and advancing Tamil Language Processing using Generative AI. I focus on exploring and implementing advanced NLP techniques tailored to Indic Languages, in paraphrase detection and paraphrase generation. Improving state-of-the-art models to align with the nuances of Tamilâ€™s rich morphological structure and linguistic diversity.

I am dedicated to optimizing the NLP pipelineâ€”from preprocessing and feature engineering to solving classification and regression tasks. By leveraging the latest methodologies and integrating language-specific adjustments, I aim to create robust and efficient NLP solutions that enhance the understanding and processing of Indic text data.

## Development Expertise

I specialize in AI and NLP development, with a strong focus on Generative AI, backend systems, and scalable AI architectures. My expertise includes building LLM-powered applications, optimizing system design, and deploying AI-driven solutions. I also have experience in data processing, web scraping, and UI/UX prototyping for AI applications.

- **AI & NLP Development**: Building AI-powered applications with a focus on LLMs, NLP, and tokenization.
- **Generative AI Applications**: Developing LLM-based applications for text generation, summarization, and domain-specific tasks.
- **Backend Development**: Designing and optimizing scalable AI architectures and backend systems.
- **System Design & Optimization**: Working on efficient model deployment and AI system integration.

## Research Focus

I am deeply passionate about advancing NLP for low-resource languages, ensuring that AI systems can understand, process, and generate text as effectively in Tamil as they do in high-resource languages like English. My research covers:

- **Tokenization Strategies**: Designing and training custom tokenizers (BPE, Unigram, WordPiece) specifically optimized for Tamil NLP tasks.
- **Paraphrase Identification**: Training BERT and other models on Tamil and English datasets for high-accuracy sentence similarity detection.
- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**: Developing entailment models with IndicBERT and XLM-RoBERTa for multilingual reasoning.
- **Efficient Model Training**: Applying hybrid tokenization and dataset-specific fine-tuning to improve model performance on downstream tasks.
